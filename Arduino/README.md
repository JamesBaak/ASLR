# ASLR - Arduino

This is an Arduino program for sequentially turning on IR emitters and recording the amount of current generated by them 
through IR receivers/photodiodes. The data collected is then sent to Serial for transmission to a Raspberry Pi 4.

This is a third year university project for undergraduate studies in computer engineering.
It was an experiment to test the feasiblity of creating an American sign language to text reader by referencing the University of 
Bristols's SensIR project.
