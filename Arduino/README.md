# ASLR - Arduino

This is an Arduino program for sequentially turning on IR emitters and recording the amount of current generated by them 
through IR receivers/photodiodes. The data collected is then sent to Serial for transmission to a Raspberry Pi 4.

This is a third year university project for undergraduate studies in computer engineering.
It was an experiment to test the feasiblity of creating an American sign language to text reader by referencing the University of 
Bristols's SensIR project.

## Set Up

What you'll need to run this program:
- x1 Arduino Uno
- x1 USB cable type A/B
- x2 CD74HC4067 (16:1) Multiplexers (Robojax)
- x4 Operational Amplifiers (LM324N - Texas Instruments)
- x14 IR Transmitters (SFH4556P - Osram Opto Semiconductors)
- x14 IR Receivers/Photodiodes (BPW34FA - Osram Opto Semiconductors)
- x14 100k Ohm Resistors
- x14 ...
- x14 22pF capacitors
- X14 2N2222A transitors (or 2N3904)

### IR Receiver Circuit

Using all 14 receivers and all 4 op amp chips will result in four identical subcircuits. Figure 1 below shows one of those four identical subcircuits. It is four transimpedance circuits (using one IR Receiver, one resistor, one capacitor each) all connected to an LM324N. The resistance values here are all 100k Ohms. The capacitance values here are all 22pF.

Figure 2 below shows the full IR Receiver Circuit once all four subcircuits have been combined.

### IR Emitter Circuit

Each emitter is part of its own transistor circuit involving a 2N2222A transitor, a X resistor connected to the transistor base and a X resitor in series with the LED at the transitor collector. This is to amplify the signal that is put out by the IR LEDs. Each transistor circuit is connected to one channel of the MUX. There are 14 of these transistor circuits.
